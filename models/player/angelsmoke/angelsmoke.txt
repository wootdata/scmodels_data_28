Description             : Converted Model for Half-Life DM

All Credit Due          : to Gabor for creating this great Model
=============================================================================

This is converted Counter Strike Model (one of a complete set).

Basically I updated the animations, but I had to edit some of the mesh to
eliminate some really really weird arm and shoulderblade distortion thingies.

All the compiling and decompiling was done in Milkshape 1.5.10.

The total modification took about 4 hour from start to finish, but there some
time spent over several months of tinkering to try and understand what the
bizarre problem was with the HLDM animations. Some amount of time was spent
checking the animations and mesh ... still a few things I'd like to fix
but oh well!

Info:

Files included:
Angesmoke.mdl - The HLDM player version of the game Angesmoke model file
Angesmoke.bmp - The picture you see when selecting the model in the game
Angesmoke.txt - This text file

Place Angesmoke.mdl, Angesmoke.bmp, Angesmoke.jpg and Angesmoke.txt in a
new folder called Angesmoke, in valve\models\player folder in your Half
Life directory.

** IMPORTANT NOTICE **
This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial
compilation, product or package without my personal approval.

This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text
file is included, unmodified, with the package.

And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache or remove the
clothes from it and release it to the world as yours, don't be lame.
(thanks to NSi for the notice).
