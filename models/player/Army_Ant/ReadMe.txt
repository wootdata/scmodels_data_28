Comment:

	This is my first succesful model that wasn't just a "test". I had the idea of a mod that pitted two ant collonies against each other. But since i have no idea how to code, i just made a model. (I'm not saying modeling is any easier though) I had a contest with my brother (Ragnarok, creator of the excelent gundam model) to see who could make the best ant like model. He took a more realistic approach, while i took a more cartoonish one. His is not yet complete. I'll release it as soon as he gets around to finishing it. I made this model without any real knowledge of creating a skin, so i took a very basic and simple texture. Very little detail. but ants don't have much detail anyway. I could have optimized it a bit better, adn maybe shaved off another 20 or so triangles, but it's very low as it is, so i didn't see the point.

	I hope you enjoy my Army Ant model. It was a labour of love and compitition. I'll leave it up to you to judge which ant is the better one, once my brother releases his.

P.S. Incase you noticed, my handle is Trunks, but i am NOT the same trunks that has released models in the past. I had my handle WAY before him. But he has been modeling for longer than i have.
