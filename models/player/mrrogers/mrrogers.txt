Info: This skin was inspired by the America's favorite children's
      television host, Mr. Fred Rogers. I really just liked the 
      idea of seeing him on a bad day, yelling "Hi, neighbor!" as he
      beat someone to death with a crowbar. Enough about that. 
      This is my first skin for public release. I've made a couple
      of skins consisting of basically my face pasted on another
      model for local LAN use only. They were pretty lame, and I
      didn't want strangers pretending to be me, anyway:) My Mister
      Rogers skin is based on the Gman model. It was made using 
      screen caps from a Mister Rogers' Neighborhood episode, some 
      cutting and pasting via Ulead PhotoImpact 4.0, and Half-Life
      Model Viewer version 2.1 . I chose this method because I have 
      very little artistic ability. I had originally planned to have
      the sweater change with the team colors, but several rogue 
      splotches and artistic ineptitude crushed that idea. If you
      are handy with palette editing and would like to help me fix
      the color shifting, I would really appreciate it. If not, here
      is Mister Rogers as is.
