I whipped this up in about three hours this afternoon -- it's not too
fancy but that's what you get for free ;).  Tell people who download it
that there's no selector bitmap -- they can choose the model from
console though, by typing "model santa" .  There aren't any remap colors
on this model --  but this time of year we're used to seeing a santa on
every corner.  If people want to make their own bitmaps, just call it
"santa.bmp" and put it in the appropriate folder.

 
Happy holidays from me & Valve to the community. Please pass this around
to relevant sites!

PS. model is my (c) 1998.   Free for entertainment use, no paid
distribution without permission -- you know the drill...

PPS for those who don't know, you can look at models in a single player
map with the console -- turn on "developer 1" and "thirdperson" (turning
it off again is "firstperson").  Cam_idealyaw and cam_idealdist will
control the camera's position.

Santa Multiplayer Selector Bitmap

This is to accompany Steve Theodore's Santa Model
so it can be selected from the Multiplayer Menu.

Put this santa.bmp in the same folder with the santa.mdl:

\sierra\half-life\valve\models\player\santa
